	He is rarely shown because he belongs to the cattery 1 colony. Meaning there is <br>behavioral problem. He is not aggressive but there are cats he does not like.He <br> also hates dogs. Mimi found him next to a museum. There was a garden, where the <br> one who threw him left him. Because the eye is closed on the thickness of the crust, <br>he cannot see. What he went through was quite difficult. 
    <br><br>He was always sick. He is especially affectionate to Mimi. Loves to cuddle and kiss. <br>Her fave food is chimkin

	<b>Given Name:</b>Mrs. Pretzel & Kittens<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female<br>
	<b>Age:</b> 5 years old<br>
	<br>
	Just this morning, we had 2 separate rescues. Mama cat with 3 kittens, placed <br>in a box and left in a dump, full of ants. A Street kittens, suffering from diarrhea <br> and flu.
    Despite the heat of the weather and the danger at the location, other people <br> were able to dispose of and abandon these animals. Heartless humans.<br><br> 

    Mrs. Pretzel babies found their loving home already. She is also spayed.

	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> August 29, 2020<br>
	<b>Given Name:</b>Lolo Marco<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Male<br>
	<b>Age:</b> 12 years old<br>
	<br>
	One of the benefits of spaying is behavior change, less aggression. Just look at <br> Marco's transformation. Dirty, many wounds because he was always fighting back then. <br>
    It was 6 years after we were able to trapped and neuter him. It is worth the effort <br> and to gain his trust and confidence. The habit does not change immediately but the <br> Kapon effect is good even physically.
    Now Marco looks like another cat. You have no <br> trace of aggression on him even if you carry or caress him. His back wound was healed. <br><br> Marco was spayed and also have the vaccine. He is now an outdoor cat.
